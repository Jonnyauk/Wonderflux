jQuery Cycle Plugin
-------------------
The jQuery Cycle plugin is comprised of two basic parts:
	1. Core logic for controlling a slideshow
	2. A plugin architecture to support a wide variety of transition effects
	   (including custom transition effects that you can write yourself).


Files
------
jquery.cycle.all.min.js contains all of the slideshow logic and all of the 
predefined transition effects that I have developed (over two dozen effects).
Use this script if you want to choose from a variety of transition effects.

jquery.cycle.min.js contains all of the slideshow logic, but only a single
transition effect: 'fade'.
Use this script if you want a 'fade' slideshow, or if you want to write your 
own custom transition.

jquery.cycle.lite.min.js is a small, streamlined slideshow script that has fewer options.
Use this script if you want a 'fade' slideshow and you are willing to trade features for file size.
